Is genetic research being held back by religion?

In recent times, humans have been editing the genetics of their children to varying effects to prevent certain hereditary medical conditions such as blindness, AIDS, and even cancer.
However, despite the progress of modern medicine there are still many moral implications to scenarios such as this. The idea of genetically altering oneself to have improved genetics did not strike accord with many individuals.

The question remained of which individuals are most opposed to the idea. The statistics will aim to test whether religious beliefs are more inclined to make individuals less accepting of genetic modification.
Historically, religious groups have been opposed to certain scientific experimentation. This could be something they would widely be opposed to. The data is recorded of those who are religious and if they would approve of genetic modification.

Data was pulled from Pewresearch.org among other sources (Change this) to discover percentages of population that correlated with the assigned attributes. The data is split between nations that the sources had data taken from.
H0 : µ = There is a correlation between religious groups and their willingness to genetically modify their children
Ha : µ ≠ There is no correlation between religious groups and their willingness to modify their children generically

A T test was performed to find the median of both Yes and No from these groups.
Around 12,000 responses with an estimate of 1,000 for each major country / region.

1,000 USA
1,000 UK
1,000 France
1,000 Germany
1,000 India
1,000 Canada
1,000 South Korea
1,000 Taiwan
1,000 Italy
1,000 Brazil
1,000 Sweden
1,000 Spain

Next are rough estimates of survey takers split of approval rates in using genetic modification:

                 Good							Bad
USA               560							240
UK                340							580
France            160							750
Germany           280							680
India             560							240
Canada            300							620
South Korea       470							480
Taiwan            440							470
Italy             210							680
Brazil            250							660
Sweden            290							630
Spain             320							570

The data is the consolidated in means within the numbers of approvals and disapprovals.
Bad    550.0
Good    348.3
Religious    282.5
ReligiousNS    702.5
Median of more educated that approve    683.333333
Median of less educated that approve     755.833333
Median age or younger approve     780.0
Older than median approve    658.333333

Looking through the results of the means, it appears that some opinions on average are much more prevalent than others. Those who see genetic modification as a good thing are much lower on average than those who see it as a bad thing. While on average, those of a younger age are much more supportive of the idea than those of an older age.
These results are likely to influence the charts of the crosstab examination.
Next is the percentages of religious beliefs separated by nations. The numbers display if an individual is both religious and believes that humans evolved over time.

           Religious						Non-Religious
USA          210							   790
UK           270							   730
France       160							   840
Germany      250							   750
India        570			           250
Canada       230							   770
South Korea  390							   610
Taiwan       390							   610
Italy        180						     820
Brazil       240						     760
Sweden       210							   790
Spain        290							   710



Means:

Bad    550.0
Good    348.3
Religious    282.5

T test category:

Good/Bad T test: Ttest_indResult(statistic=-3.3087245601502104, pvalue=0.003195237879492447)

Religious / Religious T test: Ttest_indResult(statistic=-7.3720145281208, pvalue=2.2310224422709297e-07)

Religious/ Bad T test: Ttest_indResult(statistic=-2.2950265979541946, pvalue=0.031639491891648094)

Good / Non-Religious T test: Ttest_indResult(statistic=1.304873940043538, pvalue=0.20542055589448552)

Bad / Non-Religious T test: Ttest_indResult(statistic=4.583376424595877, pvalue=0.00014511511815808642)

Good / Religious T test: Ttest_indResult(statistic=-5.940452185519697, pvalue=5.600158607249061e-06)

The P value of the combined good and bad graphs is quite low showing the connection between the two. The more interesting values are that of the Bad / Religious groups with such a small connection that it seems nearly evident the graphs are connected. Mean while the values for approving of genetic modification and being religious are quite high, showing a very weak connection.

The issue that arises here is that the data is a bit too generalized and it would be clearer how the two are connected via a Chi square test to examine the categorical data more clearly.
Crosstabing the values of the charts, we can see a few things in the fact that both Good / Religious and Bad / Non-Religious share a similar value due to what is likely the fact religious individuals dislike the idea of genetic modification as the value is lower than those who do not approve of it and are religious.

Good / Religious 24.2
Good / Non-Religious 30.4
Bad / Religious 30.4
Bad / Non-Religious 24.2

The Chi-square test allowed for much clearer results and a more concrete correlation to the idea that religious groups reject the idea of genetic modification.

With this information, we fail to reject the null hypothesis as we have proven that religious groups are more inclined to disapprove of genetic modification than non-religious groups.
