I wondered for a while, is there exactly a science or logic to why certain pokemon are picked for competitive tiers.

In the research, I had to manipulate much of the data in order to properly use it for the page.

What you are seeing is the data after it was modified several times to give more accurate results.

It used to have more data on type advantages and even other pokemon that were unevolved along with other tiers that were just not that important.

I took to dropping most pokemon that were unevolved from their final form since they rarelly if ever have a place in competitive. And most legendaries skew results anyway so they were mostly removed.

the data was still a mess so I needed to clean it more and find a more sequential number that can be predicted more easily. I ended up dropping more values this means removinf types for this chart because there isnt much need for them at the moment

The next part of the data is trained to read old results and statistic blocks in order to decide based on old standings what could influence statistics the best and what statistics different pokemon from what generation might need in total to be in certain tiers.

The first steps were to split the data based on the pokemon names and statistics.

---

After spliting it with a target of Total (as in total statistics) it was time to train the data.

The next step first had me create a Linear regression to see more of the changing nature of the total stats and utility of pokemon in tiers, but the data proved to be too dificult to wrangle and it was targeted in a different value making it a tast not worth pursuing.
This also caused the data to think it was 100% accuracy on what the data wasm which was a sign of bad target value or leakage.

Later I would switch the type of regression to boosting and analyzeing the total statistics of the pokemon rather than anything else so that it can judge a more numeric value.
